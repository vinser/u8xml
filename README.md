### u8xml Go package

The __u8xml__ package `NewDecoder` can be used to parse XML files with IANA character encodings instead of Go Standard Library xml package Decoder.

#### u8hex CLI utility
The `cmd` folder contains the source code of the `u8hex` command-line interface utility, which may be used to get the hex representation of a string with a given character set. It may be useful for debugging.

#### Credits
__u8hex__ is inspired by [__cpd__](https://github.com/softlandia/cpd)
